**Repository:** https://github.com/69030304-bot/fisch_macro.git  
**Platform:** Windows  
**Development Strategy:** Preserve & Refactor  
**Feature Scope:** Full Automation

# 1. PROJECT MISSION

You are an autonomous software development agent responsible for developing, maintaining, testing, and improving Fisch Macro.

The objective is to evolve the existing Fisch Macro application into a modern, reliable, modular, and maintainable Windows desktop automation application.

The project must preserve existing working functionality while improving its architecture, performance, reliability, usability, and maintainability.

## Core Requirements

- Windows-only desktop application.
- Full Fisch automation functionality.
- Modern and polished GUI.
- Maintainable and modular architecture.
- Reliable automation engine.
- Efficient CPU and memory usage.
- Comprehensive error handling.
- Full automated and manual testing.
- Clear documentation for future developers.
- Collaborative Git workflow for five team members.

## Development Strategy: Preserve & Refactor

This is NOT a complete rewrite project.

You MUST:

1. Inspect the existing codebase before changing anything.
2. Preserve existing working functionality.
3. Understand existing algorithms before refactoring.
4. Reuse suitable existing modules and dependencies.
5. Refactor incrementally.
6. Replace components only when technically justified.
7. Maintain compatibility with existing user configurations.
8. Add regression tests for important existing behavior.

Never rewrite the entire application simply because a different implementation appears cleaner.

---

# 2. INITIAL REPOSITORY SETUP

Before implementation, clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/69030304-bot/fisch_macro.git
cd fisch_macro
```

Then:

1. Read this AGENT.md completely.
2. Inspect repository structure.
3. Inspect README and existing documentation.
4. Inspect source code and configuration files.
5. Identify programming language and frameworks.
6. Identify the current application entry point.
7. Identify existing dependencies and build tools.
8. Inspect Git branches and working-tree status.
9. Identify existing tests.
10. Run the existing application and tests where possible.

Do not assume that the project uses Python, PySide6, PyQt, Tkinter, SQLite, or any other framework until verified from the repository.

If cloning fails:

- Investigate repository access and authentication.
- Verify the repository URL.
- Do not silently substitute another repository.
- Report the exact blocker.

Do not begin major implementation until the initial audit is complete.

---

---

# 5. GIT BRANCH STRATEGY

Never work directly on `main`.

The repository must use the following branch structure:

## Main Branches

### main

Purpose:

- Stable production version.
- Release-ready code.
- Verified application versions.

Rules:

- No direct development.
- No direct commits from team members.
- No merging without explicit project maintainer approval.

### develop

Purpose:

- Shared integration branch.
- Collect completed team contributions.
- Run integration testing.
- Verify cross-module compatibility.

Rules:

- Changes must arrive through Pull Requests.
- CI must be checked before integration.
- Conflicts must be reviewed.
- Do not merge untested work.

## Team Branches

```text
team/69030450-qa-docs
team/69030377-ux-ui
team/69030343-backend-db
team/69030304-python-automation
team/69030208-gui-db
```

Each member is responsible for their designated branch.

## Task Branches

For independent tasks, create additional task branches.

Examples:

```text
feature/69030304-macro-engine
feature/69030304-fishing-workflow
feature/69030377-dashboard-design
feature/69030208-gui-components
feature/69030343-database-schema
fix/69030450-regression-tests
refactor/69030304-core-architecture
docs/69030450-user-manual
```

Task branches should be created from the relevant member branch or agreed integration base.

After implementation:

1. Test the changes.
2. Commit changes.
3. Push the task branch.
4. Open a Pull Request into the relevant member branch.
5. Review and integrate.
6. Open a Pull Request from the member branch into `develop` when the work is ready.

Avoid unnecessary branch proliferation.

---

# 6. GIT OPERATING RULES

Before starting work:

```bash
git status
git branch --show-current
git fetch origin
```

Never discard uncommitted changes belonging to another task.

Before changing branches, inspect the working tree.

If there are uncommitted changes:

- Determine their ownership.
- Preserve them.
- Commit or safely stash only when appropriate.
- Never overwrite another member's work.

## Commit Standards

Use clear and meaningful commit messages.

Examples:

```text
docs: add project architecture documentation
feat: implement fishing workflow
feat: add macro engine state management
fix: release input on emergency stop
refactor: separate automation from UI
test: add fishing workflow regression tests
ui: improve dashboard layout
```

Commit only logically related changes.

Review the complete diff before committing:

```bash
git diff
git diff --staged
```

## Remote Git Permissions

Agents may:

- Clone the repository.
- Fetch remote changes.
- Create local branches.
- Commit local changes.
- Push to authorized team/task branches.
- Open Pull Requests targeting `develop`.
- Review Pull Requests.
- Check CI results.

Agents MUST NOT perform these actions without explicit user approval:

- Merge into `main`.
- Push directly to `main`.
- Delete protected branches.
- Force-push.
- Rewrite shared Git history.
- Modify repository security settings.
- Publish a release.

Never claim a push, PR, or merge succeeded without verifying the result.

---

# 7. TARGET SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

The architecture must be based on the actual existing codebase.

The following is the desired logical architecture.

```text

├── Presentation Layer
│   ├── Dashboard
│   ├── Macro Controls
│   ├── Settings
│   ├── Profiles
│   ├── Logs
│   └── Theme System

    ├── Diagnostics
    └── Performance Monitoring
```

Do not create unnecessary abstractions.

Use the existing programming language and framework unless a documented technical reason justifies changing them.

5. Add or update tests.
6. Refactor incrementally.
7. Verify existing behavior.

Never:

- Delete working features without approval.

- Start.
- Stop.
- Pause.
- Resume.
- Emergency stop.
- Timeout handling.
- Exception handling.
- Safe cancellation.
- Input cleanup.
- Duplicate-task prevention.
- Safe shutdown.

Emergency stop must take priority over normal automation.

Priorities:

1. Low idle CPU usage.
2. Reasonable memory usage.
3. Responsive GUI.
4. Efficient screen capture.
5. Efficient image processing.
6. Controlled background tasks.

- Verify Windows build.

If development is performed outside Windows:

- Run all available automated tests.

When a test fails:

1. Identify the cause.
2. Determine whether it was introduced by the current change.
3. Fix failures caused by your changes.
4. Re-run affected tests.
5. Run relevant regression tests.
6. Document unrelated pre-existing failures.

---

# 14. CI AND PULL REQUEST REQUIREMENTS

Every integration Pull Request must include:

---

# 20. FINAL DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES

Always prioritize:

1. Existing functionality preservation.
2. Automation reliability.
3. Application stability.
4. Team collaboration.
5. Clear module ownership.
6. Maintainable architecture.
7. Modern user experience.
8. Efficient resource usage.
9. Comprehensive testing.
10. Accurate documentation.

The goal is to improve Fisch Macro without unnecessarily destroying or replacing what already works.

Every change must be understandable, testable, documented, and safe to integrate.

**Build incrementally. Test continuously. Collaborate clearly. Preserve existing functionality. Never compromise project stability for speed.**
